# Logic-Gate-Simulation
This software is used to build complex compound gate using elementry logic gate
The app support grouping(group elementry gates and move together), duplication(duplicate a elementry
or a set of gates). 

The difference between variant 1 and 2 is that in variant 1. when combining with an compound gate
, the program only consider the root gate (the elementry gate within the compound gate being 
clicked on) and combine that with another root gate or elemetry gate.

In variant 2, when combining with an compound gate, the program considers all of the elementry/compound 
gate within the clicked compound gate, and combine it with another compound gate clicked on or another 
elementry gate to form a super group.
